## 🎯 Overview

This project implements a **Weighted Dynamic Data Replication Algorithm** that analyzes file access logs to automatically determine optimal replication factors. The system continuously monitors access patterns and adjusts replica counts to:

- ✅ **Maximize availability** for frequently accessed files (Hot data)
- 💰 **Minimize storage costs** by reducing replicas for rarely accessed files (Cold data)
- ⚖️ **Balance performance and efficiency** for moderately accessed files (Warm data)
- 🔒 **Ensure data safety** through Reed-Solomon erasure coding for cold data

### Key Concepts

- **Temporal Locality**: Recent access patterns predict future access behavior
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Automatically calculated based on system-wide access patterns
- **Iterative Optimization**: Replication factors evolve over time as access patterns change

---

## 🧮 Algorithm

The system implements the following algorithm from the research paper:

### Step-by-Step Process

```
1. Set time interval (t)
2. For each time interval:
   a. Read access logs for interval t
   b. For each file fi:
      - Calculate access count (ac_i)
      - Calculate distinct node count (dnc_i)
      - Calculate weight (w_i) based on node coverage
      - Calculate popularity degree: PD_i = (ac_i × dnc_i × w_i) / crf_i
   c. Calculate dynamic threshold: T = mean(PD) / DN_count
   d. Classify files:
      - Hot: PD_i ≥ T AND w_i ∈ {3, 4}
      - Warm: (PD_i ≥ T AND w_i ∈ {1, 2}) OR (PD_i < T AND w_i ∈ {3, 4})
      - Cold: PD_i < T AND w_i ∈ {1, 2}
   e. Calculate new replication factors:
      - Hot/Warm: nrf_i = (crf_i × dnc_i) / DN_count
      - Cold: nrf_i = 1 + Erasure Coding
   f. Update system state for next interval
```

### Weight Calculation

| Node Coverage | Weight (w_i) |
|--------------|--------------|
| ≥ 75% nodes  | 4            |
| ≥ 50% nodes  | 3            |
| ≥ 25% nodes  | 2            |
| < 25% nodes  | 1            |

## 🔬 Implementation Details

### Core Classes

#### `ReplicaAlgorithm` (replica_clean.py)

Main algorithm controller that orchestrates the entire process.

**Key Methods:**
- `run()`: Main execution loop
- `set_time_interval()`: Divides logs into time intervals
- `process_files()`: Calculates metrics for each file
- `classify_files()`: Categorizes files as Hot/Warm/Cold
- `calculate_new_rf_for_hot_warm()`: Computes new RF for Hot/Warm files
- `process_cold_data()`: Handles cold data with erasure coding
- `save_interval_results()`: Exports results to CSV

#### `Calculator` (calculator.py)

Mathematical computation utilities.

**Methods:**
- `calculate_weight()`: Computes w_i based on node coverage
- `calculate_popularity_degree()`: Computes PD_i using formula
- `calculate_threshold()`: Computes dynamic threshold T

### State Management

The system maintains state across intervals using `self.current_rf`:

```python
# Interval 1
file_A.txt: crf=3 → nrf=2

# Interval 2 (uses previous nrf as crf)
file_A.txt: crf=2 → nrf=3

# Interval 3
file_A.txt: crf=3 → nrf=1
```

This ensures the **iterative nature** described in the paper, where replication factors evolve dynamically.

## 📚 Research Paper

This implementation is based on the following research paper:

**Title:** [A Dynamic Replica Factor Calculator for Weighted Dynamic Replication Management in Cloud Storage Systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187705091830886X)

**Authors:** Suji Gopinath, Elizabeth Sherly

**Publication:** Procedia Computer Science 132 (2018) 1771–1780  
**Conference:** International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Data Science (ICCIDS 2018)

**Abstract:**
> Data replication is a widely-used technique in cloud storage systems to ensure availability of data. In static replication policies, the number of replicas to be created is decided statically at the time of cloud system setup. The replication of data needs to be dynamic considering changing pattern in user request and storage capacity. This will ensure that storage space is not wasted by keeping unnecessary replicas for least used data. In this work, a strategy is proposed to dynamically set the replica factor for each data item considering the popularity of data, its current replication factor and the number of active nodes present in the cloud storage.

**Key Contributions:**
- Weighted dynamic data replication algorithm
- 4-point weightage scheme for node coverage
- Dynamic threshold calculation based on popularity degree
- Reed-Solomon (10,4) erasure coding integration
- Temporal locality-based classification (Hot/Warm/Cold)
